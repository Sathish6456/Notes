we can create ReactJS by using this command
npx create-react-app demo1

we can run our application by using 
npm start , if it is angular app we are using the ng serve 
when we are giving the start command it starts our application and automatically opens the browsers on 3000 port number

cd.. it will return to the folder

if we give the "rsf" 

it will gives a function

if we use the "rcfc" 

it gives the constructors and many methods 

we can bind that property in parent component by using tag 

Components are 2 types in the React 
1)Functional Component - in the functional componenet we are passing the arguments 
2)Class Component	- in the class componenet we can't passing the arguments so we can create the constroctor in that 
			constructors we can pass the arguments 

in react we can create components manually 


Export in JS - if we want use the class out side of our JS file we can use the Export 

onChange- when we are using this event this can print each and every value when we are giving 
ex:Sathish 

in the console it prints the 
S
Sa
Sat
Sath
Sathi
Sathis
Sathish 

----------------------------------------------------****Adding Styles*****--------------------------------------------------------
"INLINE" styles in the ReactApp
we can create like object in function component
ex:let headStyle ={
        padding:"20px",
        backgroundColor:"blue",
        foregroundColor:"white"
    } 

 <h1 style={headStyle}>Example1</h1>  //we can add the styles internally 
<p style={{backgroundColor:"orange",foregroundColor:"white"}}>This is an inline stylesheet we add styles internally it means with in the tags we can add stylings</p>
	//from above syntax we can add the inline stylesheet

and we can also add the style externally and globally like in Angular

---------------*****************---------------------
AXIOS

ReactJS will use the axios for connecting to DataBase 
we can install the axios by using below command
npm insall axios  
it was installing for that particular project only, which we are in the project
***************
We can put the @CrossOrigin for our controller class in our spring boot application with the React app port 
ex:@CrossOrigin(origins ="http:/localhost:3000")

Our Spring boot app interact with React App(Which was running)


-------------------********************---------------------------

ROUTING

we have to add the routing module in our project 

by using the below command we can install the routing for our project  

npm install react-router-dom@6
and also we have to import BrowserRouter from 'react-router-dom'; and add the tag index.js file


and also we have to import in the app.js import {} from 'react-router-dom';

---------------**********************-----------------------------------
Redux

we can install the redux by using this below command 
npm install redux react-redux
we have to create the redux under the src

Action object is an object 

we have to import the provider from the react-redux
