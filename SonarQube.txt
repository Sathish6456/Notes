Maintaining the code quality is the ar most important thing throughout the development of the project.we would want to find out issues in the code as soon as
possible and we want to be done as a continous process



Code issues such as
-If there are unnecessary import
-Wether the package appropriate or not
-If there is any possibility of null pointer exception
-If there are any unnecessary syster.out.prrintln in the code
-If there are unncessary blank methods
-If there are complex loops in the code..
To Acheive this we have a tool called as SONAR QUBE WHich helps us to give code quality and standards



Steps to use SONAR QUBE
1.Download Sonar Qube
2.Open bin directory and depending on the operating system we are using run sonar server
3.Sonar Cube consists of following components 
	sonar qube server--This is a web application which by default runs on http://localhost:9000
	->This shows sonar Analysis report

By default sonaqube gives you user name as admin password also admin

we can start the sonar by using startsonar


if we add the new stages in the git file and we click build now we can see in the sonarqube page added new code and with different colour
