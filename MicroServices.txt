Eureka Server will register our couple of services

we have to add an annotation in eureka server application
@EnableEurekaServer

in the message application
Add this annotation EurekaServer DiscoveryClient  and the dependancy in the pom.xml (Dependancies For the both applications)

We have the add the annotation and dependancies for our client application @EnableFeignClients, OpenFeign dependancy
ex:DisplayService Application 

we can give the name in the app.properties that name should be displayed on the eureka server 
ex:spring.application.name=messageservice, spring.application.name=displayservice

We no need to use the RestTemplate in Microservices
	we can create an of our Client Interface in that interface we have to create method, and the method name should 
	match with what we have write in the Restcontroller method
	we can add the @FeignClient annotation for that interface
	in the restcontroller we no need to use the RestTemplate 

ServiceName 			port no
messageservice			8080
displayservice			8082
Eureka Server			8761
ApiGateWay			9090
zipkin 				9411
configserver 			8888 we have add the 2 dependancies config server and eureka discovery client

mvn clean - it deletes all compiled artifacts(target directory) 
 
mvn package - it compiles the business source code, run all test cases and create artifact(jar or war)

set M2_HOME=D:\Maven-3.3.9\Apache-maven-3.3.9

set PATH=%JAVA_HOME%\bin;%M2_HOME%\bin;%PATH%;

set JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_91

logging 

Distrubuted logging,tracing 
	-id
we hwve to add the slueth dependancy 

[Servicename,traceid,span id]- in the console these are displayed

Checking these logs across all console is a difficult task (Not possible)
All the logs in GUI form 
		-based on servicename 
		-traceid


------***-------
Zipkin 
-centralized location for all application 

----*******------------
configserver 8888 
centralized location for storing all application properties for all microservices 
		where is the centralized location ?

		locally - not used in production (good for testing ,devolopment )
		gitrepo -recommended

we have add the 2 dependancies config server and eureka discovery client
we can put annotation @EnableEurekaClient in the application


in the production if we changes in the data ex:git zensartechnologies

we have to add the actuator dependancy and add the propertiesin the messageservice

management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=refresh and 
add the annotation in the messagerest controller @RefreshScope

while we are creating a new file in repository the name should be match with that microsevices name
ex:messageservice


when we are changes the data in git we have to post the url in postman then refresh the chrome 
http://admw46zlpc1170.ind.zensar.com:8082/actuator/refresh
ex: Zensar Technologies Pune to Zensar Technologies India


----------------************------------------------------------
Steps for which we should run microservices 

1.Run Eureka Server (Keep running forever)		8761
2.Run Config Server(keep it running)			8888
		-Behind th scene we can change property value(Typically git hub)
3.Run ApiGateway(Keep it running)			9090
4.Zipkin Server(Keep it running)			9411

-WithOut Above 4 steps we can't run our microservices
